How I thought the test went
---------------------------

- fine & fun

- decided to include different types of players to make it more interesting

- decided to allow multiple players and decide the winner based on response time

- players hold the card objects they won even though no operations are done on these cards, thus a simple integer count
would have sufficed. If the game was extended to be more complicated or have a graphical element this may have had more use.

It could be argued that my solution is over engineered given the scope of the game, however I wanted to demonstrate
how one may go about architecting the game assuming it would see significant usage potentially requiring maintenance
and upgrades in the future.

What I would do different with more time
----------------------------------------

- handle draws correctly
- players that mis-snap are arbitrarily penalized, it would be better if this was elaborated on, although in the full
game it would make more sense
- fuller rules of snap
- more tests
- implement ui
- implement human players
- package the app
- command line arguments / entering numbers is clunky; invalid command line arguments just ask for another number
instead of indicating their invalidness
